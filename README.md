# Minesweeper

A game of minesweeper made with Phaser and SlickUI. Made for a job interview.

## Requirements

[x] Playable on both Desktop & Mobile browsers

[x] 9x9 grid

[x] 10 mines

[x] Left click to clear a tile

[x] Right click to flag a tile as a bomb

[x] When there are no tiles left that are not bombs, tell the player they won

[x] When the player clears a tile that is a bomb, tell the player they lost

## Bonuses

[x] Different grid sizes (either user selectable, or some premade choices)

[x] Different mine counts, with a max of number of tiles/3. Play the game to determine what feels best here.

[ ] Stretch Goal: Build a simple “bot” that auto plays the game

## I am judged on

- Technical correctness (does the game work as described here)
- Code quality
- User Experience and gameplay feedback (does the game feel fun?) (Note that this isn’t related to the quality of visual assets, but more user interaction)
